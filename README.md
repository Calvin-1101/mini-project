# mini-project
Preface:
This project is not meant to be a trading algorithm script to make money. Instead it is meant to learn fundamental end-to-end data/machine learning skills 
Complex trading strategies involving multiple indicators will not be used. 

Data source: 
The project will be built and tested on the BTC/USD 5 minute OLHCV historical data. These will be accessed via the Yahoo Finance Library in Python
